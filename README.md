# wiki-search-angular2
Learning Angular 2 HTTP features with a few tweaks on their doc's Wikipedia example.

What I tweaked:
- General styling
- Animation features
- Clicking on a search result title links to its corresponding Wikipedia page


This was created with the Angular 2 CLI.

`npm install` to download dependencies

`ng serve` runs the dev server on port 4200.
